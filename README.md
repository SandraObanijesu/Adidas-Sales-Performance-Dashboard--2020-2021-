As part of my learning journey in data analytics, I challenged myself to design a simple yet insightful dashboard using Microsoft Excel. The dataset was provided through a financial modeling course I’m currently taking.

This project helped me build on two essential analytics skills: **visual storytelling** and **business insight extraction**.

## Dashboard Focus

The dashboard analyzes Adidas sales performance across:

- **Retailers**: West Gear, Foot Locker, Sport Direct, Kohl’s, Amazon, and Walmart  
- **Sales Channels**: In-store, Online, Outlet  
- **Regions**: U.S. regions including Northeast, South, West, Midwest and Southeast  
- **Monthly Trends**: 2020 to 2021

## Key Insights

- **Total sales** from 2020 to 2021 amounted to approximately $899.9 million across six major retailers and six product categories.
- Sales increased significantly from $182 million in 2020 to about $718 million in 2021, reflecting a 295% growth. This surge can be attributed in part to the addition of Amazon in 2021, which alone generated $78 million (10.85%) of that year’s sales.
- Monthly sales fluctuated through 2020 but rose sharply in January 2021 ($55M), peaked in July and again in December 2021 with $78M each.

- Top-selling products included Men’s Street Footwear ($209M), Women’s Apparel ($179M), and Men’s Athletic Footwear ($154M).  
- Foot Locker and West Gear were the leading retailers, contributing over 50% of total sales. In contrast, Amazon and Walmart each accounted for less than $80M across both years.
- In-store purchases accounted for 40% of total sales, followed by outlet (33%) and online (27%). In-store was the most used channel in the Northeast, West, and Southeast regions, while online was more prominent in the Southeast and South.
