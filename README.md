## Project Goal
As part of my data analytics learning journey, I challenged myself to create a simple but insightful dashboard using Microsoft Excel. The dataset was provided through a financial modeling course I’m currently taking.
This project helped me strengthen two essential skills in analytics:
- **Visual storytelling**
- **Extracting business insights**
